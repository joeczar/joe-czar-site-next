I Just spent the day rebuilding this tiny thing with Next.js. It was an experience. I've been working with Angular for over 6 months and before that it was Nuxt & Vue. Next certainly has a different vibe. I'm looking forward to getting this up and going and writing regularly again. But for now, bedtime.
